## Overview

HP reads like a long-running consumer-electronics catalog crossed with an enterprise-software product page. The whole system sits on **pure white** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`) with thin gray panels (`{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}`) for alternating section bands. There is one chromatic action color — **HP Electric Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — `#024ad8`) — and one ink color (`{colors.ink}` — `#1a1a1a`); together they do ninety percent of the work. Type is a single family across every surface: **Forma DJR Micro**, HP's bespoke geometric grotesque, set at weight 500 for headlines and 400 for body — clean, neutral, slightly mechanical.

The signature gesture is **angular blue chevrons** — sharp 0-radius slashes derived from the HP wordmark's pair of parallel slashes — that anchor the homepage hero, the laptop-page hero, and the printer pricing page. They appear on the left and right edges of the primary banner card, layered behind product photography. Outside those decorative slashes, every other surface is rectilinear with **soft 8–16px corners** on cards and a 4px corner on buttons.

The system breaks into three voice modes: a **white commercial body** for product browsing (cards, category icons, pricing tiers); a **dark navy slab** (`{colors.ink}` near-black) for testimonial bands, the closing "How can we help?" footer-prelude, and the page footer; and a **light fog band** (`{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}`) for utility sections like comparison strips and FAQ accordions. The blue accent appears only on filled CTAs, link text, the chevron decorations, and the active price-stamp on a featured tier — never as a section background.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pure white canvas (`{colors.canvas}`) with deep ink (`{colors.ink}`) running every body surface; light fog bands (`{colors.cloud}`, `{colors.fog}`) alternate for section rhythm
- HP Electric Blue (`{colors.primary}`) is the lone CTA fill and link color; it appears at most twice per viewport
- Bespoke Forma DJR Micro across every surface — display, body, button, caption — at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700
- Cards round at `{rounded.xl}` (16px) for product/pricing tiles; buttons sit at `{rounded.md}` (4px) with capitalize labels
- Geometric blue chevrons (`{colors.primary}` rectangles cut at 45°) frame hero photography and reinforce the wordmark
- Dark-navy slabs (`{colors.ink}`) close every page rhythm — testimonial bands, "how can we help?" prelude, and the footer
- Section rhythm: utility-strip → top nav → white body → cloud-band → ink slab → cloud-band → ink footer

## Colors

> **No Interaction sub-section.** Hover colors are silently filtered. Allowed sub-sections: Brand & Accent, Surface, Text, Semantic.

### Brand & Accent
- **HP Electric Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — `#024ad8`): the system's lone signal — primary CTA fill, link color, chevron-decoration fill, active sub-nav indicator. Reserved.
- **Bright Blue** (`{colors.primary-bright}` — `#296ef9`): a slightly lighter variant used inside dark slabs (testimonial-card buttons, dark-band CTA links) where the deeper blue would muddy.
- **Deep Navy** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#0e3191`): pressed state for the primary CTA and the visited-link color.
- **Soft Blue** (`{colors.primary-soft}` — `#c9e0fc`): pale-blue surface used inside customer-story cards and selection chips.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): the universal page background. White, full opacity.
- **Paper** (`{colors.paper}` — `#ffffff`): card surfaces — same white as canvas, with hairline borders or shadows providing the lift.
- **Cloud** (`{colors.cloud}` — `#f7f7f7`): the lightest gray section band, used for alternating-row backgrounds and product-feature card groups.
- **Fog** (`{colors.fog}` — `#e8e8e8`): a slightly darker gray surface band, used for FAQ outer panels and the "Trending laptops" header strip.
- **Steel** (`{colors.steel}` — `#c2c2c2`): hairline border used on outlined elements with stronger emphasis (focus states, active filter).
- **Bloom Coral / Bloom Rose** (`{colors.bloom-coral}` / `{colors.bloom-rose}` — `#ff5050`, `#f9d4d2`): the "Get 25% off" sale-tag chip + soft pink lifestyle accent on the sale hero.
- **Storm Mist / Sea / Deep** (`{colors.storm-mist}`, `{colors.storm-sea}`, `{colors.storm-deep}` — `#8ebdce`, `#7fadbe`, `#356373`): the teal-storm tones reserved for the printer-plan illustration backdrop and supporting infographic accents.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1a1a1a`): the universal text color on white surfaces — headlines, body, button labels, navigation.
- **Ink Deep** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#000000`): pure black used for the wordmark and 1px hairline strokes around badge outlines.
- **Ink Soft** (`{colors.ink-soft}` — `#292929`): an alternate near-black used inside dark-navy slabs as a subtle textural shift.
- **On Ink** (`{colors.on-ink}` — `#ffffff`): pure white used for headline and body text on every dark-navy slab.
- **Charcoal** (`{colors.charcoal}` — `#3d3d3d`): muted body color on white surfaces — secondary descriptions, fine-print disclaimers.
- **Graphite** (`{colors.graphite}` — `#636363`): smaller-print color, used for legal lines and timestamp metadata.

### Semantic
- **Bloom Deep** (`{colors.bloom-deep}` — `#b3262b`) + **Bloom Wine** (`{colors.bloom-wine}` — `#5a1313`): error and discount-emphasis colors. The deep brick reads as "sale" or "destructive" depending on placement.
- **Storm Deep** (`{colors.storm-deep}` — `#356373`): used as a neutral status accent (e.g., printer-plan tier "Versatile" tier color).

## Typography

### Font Family

The voice is **single-family**: Forma DJR Micro (HP's bespoke geometric grotesque, fallback Arial) across every surface — display, body, button, caption. Forma DJR Micro is a wide, slightly rounded grotesque designed at small optical sizes to stay legible at UI-chrome scale. HP runs it at weight 400 for body, 500 for display headlines, 600/700 for emphasis and button labels.

The 16/14/12-px caption tier carries the catalog metadata — model numbers, spec rows, fine print — at weight 400 with a 1.4–1.5 line-height. Button labels lift to weight 600/700 with positive 0.5–1.1px letter-spacing and uppercase transform — the only place the system tracks letters.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 72px | 500 | 1.0 | 0 | Hero headline (homepage, laptop hub) |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 56px | 500 | 1.0 | 0 | Section headlines on landing pages |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 44px | 500 | 1.0 | 0 | Sub-section headlines on shop pages |

| `{typography.display-sm}` | 24px | 500 | 1.17 | 0 | Card titles, pricing-tier names |
| `{typography.display-xs}` | 20px | 500 | 1.0 | 0 | Inline list headers, accordion labels |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.33 | 0 | Lead paragraphs |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.38 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-emphasis}` | 16px | 500 | 1.38 | 0 | Bolded run-in copy |
| `{typography.caption-md}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Specs, metadata, captions |

| `{typography.link-md}` | 16px | 500 | 1.38 | 0 | Inline link emphasis |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 14px | 600 | 1.4 | 0.7px | Primary/secondary button labels (uppercase) |
| `{typography.button-sm}` | 12.6px | 700 | 1.0 | 0.126px | Compact button labels in tight cells |
| `{typography.price-md}` | 24px | 500 | 1.17 | 0 | Tier and product price stamps |

### Principles

The typographic decision worth flagging: HP runs **weight 500 for every display size**, including the largest 72px hero headline. Most editorial systems jump to 600/700 at hero scale; HP doesn't. The result feels open and approachable rather than commanding — appropriate for a brand that sells across consumer, SMB, and enterprise audiences in the same catalog.

Forma DJR Micro's rounded-grotesque shapes do most of the warmth. There's no italic in the system except inside legal disclaimers; emphasis is carried by weight (500 → body-emphasis, 700 → caption-bold) instead.

### Note on Font Substitutes

Forma DJR Micro is proprietary (Commercial Type / Mark Caneso). Closest open-source substitutes:
- **Inter** at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 — slightly narrower than Forma DJR Micro; bump font-size by ~3% to compensate
- **Manrope** at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 — closer in proportion, gentler curves; use directly with no metric adjustment
- **Roboto** at weights 400 / 500 / 700 — flatter character; use as last-resort fallback

When swapping, set body line-height to 1.4 and display line-height to 1.0 explicitly — the Forma DJR Micro line-height numbers are tight, and most substitutes default looser.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 8px. Smaller half-step at 4px. The scale is gentle — most card padding lands at 16px or 24px; section gap at 80px.
- **Tokens (front matter)**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 20px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.section}` 80px
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.section}` (80px) vertical between major bands on desktop; collapses to ~48px on mobile.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xl}` (24px) for product cards; `{spacing.xxl}` (32px) for promo strips and feature cards; `{spacing.md}` (16px) for compact article tiles.
- **Gutter**: `{spacing.xl}` (24px) between grid columns at desktop; `{spacing.md}` (16px) on tablet/mobile.

The 80px section gap is the universal rhythm constant — it appears between every major homepage band, between the hero and the comparison table on the printer-plan page, and between feature rows on the laptop-shop page.

### Grid & Container

- **Desktop max-width**: 1366px content container with full-bleed-on-canvas section backgrounds.
- **Hero**: a single full-width photo card (homepage and laptop-hub hero) with the headline overlay positioned upper-left or upper-right.
- **Product family grid**: 4 columns at >1200px, 3 at 1024–1199px, 2 at 768–1023px, 1 below 768px.
- **Pricing tiers**: 4 columns at >1024px, 2x2 grid at 768–1023px, single-column accordion below 768px.
- **Footer**: 5-column link grid at >1024px, collapsing to 2-column then accordion on mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace is **commercial-clean** — generous around hero photography, tight around catalog spec rows. Product cards leave breathing room above and below the photo (≥32px) so the laptop or printer reads as a hero shot rather than a thumbnail. The fine-print disclaimer regions (legal, footnote rows) tighten line-height to 1.3 and shrink type to 11–12px so the bulk of fine print stays compact.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Flat | No border, no shadow. | Section bands (white, cloud, fog), full-bleed photo heroes |
| 1 — Hairline | 1px solid `{colors.hairline}` (`#e8e8e8`) border, no shadow. | Outlined buttons, comparison-table cells, FAQ accordion outers |
| 2 — Soft Lift | `0 2px 8px rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.08)`. | Product cards, pricing-tier columns, customer-story tiles |
| 3 — Floating Modal | `0 8px 24px rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.12)`. | Add-to-cart drawer, mobile-nav sheet, image zoom modal |

The system is mostly flat — depth is communicated by **color contrast** (cloud-band vs. white card on the same band) rather than shadow elevation. The Soft Lift level is the workhorse for the catalog — every product tile and pricing column gets it; nothing else does. Modal-floating is rare and reserved for transient overlays.

### Decorative Depth

The system's most distinctive depth gesture is the **HP blue chevron pair** — two angular `{colors.primary}` slashes (no radius, no shadow) that sit on the left and right of the homepage hero card and the laptop-shop hero. They're not decorative noise; they're a literal echo of the HP wordmark's two parallel slashes, scaled up to architectural size. Treat them as a brand artifact, not a generic geometric flourish.

Photography on the homepage and laptop-shop pages frames product imagery inside `{rounded.xl}` (16px) containers with a soft 1px hairline. Lifestyle photography (testimonials, "How HP works for X") sits full-bleed inside dark-navy slabs without rounding.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0px | Hero chevron decorations, full-bleed photo heroes, marquee strips |
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Secondary chip backgrounds, sale-tag pills |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 3px | Default secondary CTA radius (small touch zones) |
| `{rounded.md}` | 4px | Primary buttons, secondary buttons, text inputs |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 8px | Badge pills, category-icon cards, FAQ row containers |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Product cards, pricing tiers, customer-story tiles, photo frames |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Category sub-nav tabs, search-pill input, filter chips |

The system maintains a clear two-tier philosophy: **buttons stay sharp** (4px, almost rectilinear) while **cards and photo frames stay soft** (16px). This split is the visual signature — sharp interactive elements against softer container surfaces.

### Photography Geometry

Hero photography sits in `{rounded.xl}` (16px) frames with no border. Product family thumbnails inside the laptop-grid are 1:1 (square) on a `{colors.canvas}` background, padded so the laptop is shown at ~70% of the frame. Customer-story photography uses 16:9 inside the same `{rounded.xl}` frame. There are no full-bleed circular avatars; testimonial avatars are 4px-rounded squares.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for the primary CTA, link color, and `chevron-decoration` motif — at most twice per viewport
- Set every headline in Forma DJR Micro at weight 500 with line-height 1.0 — resist the urge to bump weight at hero scale
- Use `{rounded.xl}` (16px) for cards and photo frames; `{rounded.md}` (4px) for buttons and inputs — keep the two-tier split sharp
- Pair white `{colors.canvas}` body bands with `{colors.cloud}` (`#f7f7f7`) alternating bands; let the gray do the breathing
- Close every page rhythm with a dark-navy `{colors.ink}` slab — the "How can we help?" prelude + footer
- Set button labels in uppercase with `{typography.button-md}` (0.7px tracking) — the only place the system tracks letters
- Use Soft Lift shadow exclusively for product cards and pricing tiers — leave section bands flat
- Frame product photography inside `{rounded.xl}` containers; never use full-bleed circular masks

### Don't
- Don't introduce secondary saturated colors outside `{colors.primary}` family + the `bloom-coral` sale-tag and `storm` printer-plan accents
- Don't apply heavy material shadows — depth is via color contrast (cloud vs. white) and Soft Lift only
- Don't round buttons above `{rounded.md}` (4px); a soft 8px+ button reads as a different brand
- Don't run Forma DJR Micro below 12px — small caption at 11px is the floor
- Don't use the chevron decoration as inline noise; it is a hero-only architectural element tied to the wordmark
- Don't drop ink text opacity to create hierarchy — switch surface or shift to `{colors.charcoal}` / `{colors.graphite}` instead
- Don't replace the HP wordmark with a generic sans lockup; the wordmark is a custom mark with its own ratio

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 480px | Single-column stack; hamburger nav; section padding drops to ~48px; hero serif scales to ~36px |
| Mobile-Large | 480–767px | Same column count; hero scales to ~44px; pricing tiers stack vertically |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | 2-column product grid; pricing 2x2; nav still full text labels |
| Desktop | 1024–1279px | 3-column product grid; 4-column pricing; full nav |
| Desktop-Large | ≥ 1280px | 4-column product grid; 1366px content max-width with full-bleed bands |

### Touch Targets

Every interactive element clears 44×44px on mobile. `button-primary` at 44px height + 24px horizontal padding meets WCAG-AAA touch target. `category-tab` at 8px 20px padding bumps to 12px 24px on touch screens. Nav-link tap areas extend invisibly beyond the text run to the full 44px row height. Sticky cart/sign-in icons in the top nav use 44×44 invisible hit boxes around their visible 24×24 glyph.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Utility strip**: stays visible on every breakpoint; dropdowns collapse into a single "Account" icon below 768px
- **Top nav**: middle category list collapses into a hamburger drawer below 1024px; the right-side Search + Sign-in + Cart stay visible
- **Hero**: stays single-column at every breakpoint; chevron decorations shrink to ~60% size on tablet and disappear entirely on mobile
- **Product family grid**: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 column as breakpoints shrink; cards keep `{rounded.xl}` corners at every size
- **Pricing comparison table**: 4-column grid on desktop collapses to 2x2 on tablet, then stacks into individual accordion-style cards on mobile
- **Footer**: 5-column link grid → 2-column tablet → single-column accordion on mobile; HP wordmark stays flush left

### Image Behavior

Hero photography uses `{rounded.xl}` containers at every breakpoint. The chevron decorations vanish on mobile; the underlying photo card centers in the viewport. Lifestyle photography in the testimonial and "how-can-we-help" bands maintains 16:9 ratio with horizontal cropping rather than letterboxing on mobile. There are no art-direction crop swaps between desktop and mobile — the same image is used at every size.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time; resist refactoring an entire section in one pass
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{typography.display-xxl}`, `{rounded.xl}`, `card-product`) — do not paraphrase to hex/px in prose
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically
4. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-disabled`, `-focused`); never bury state inside prose
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; reach for `{typography.body-emphasis}` for run-in bolds; keep display sizes for true heading roles
6. Keep `{colors.primary}` scarce — at most two flame elements per viewport (one CTA + one chevron decoration). Three flame items in one viewport is over-saturation
7. When introducing a new section band, choose from `{colors.canvas}` / `{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}` / `{colors.ink}` — six pre-defined surface modes is the entire surface vocabulary

## Implementation Map

Everything above is the spec. This section records how it lands in `apps/web` so
the two never drift.

### Where tokens live

`apps/web/src/index.css` is the single source of truth in code. Raw token values
sit in `:root` under their DESIGN.md names (`--primary`, `--canvas`, `--ink`,
`--cloud`, …), then `@theme inline` exposes them as Tailwind v4 utilities.
Because the theme is `inline`, utilities compile to `var(--token)` rather than a
frozen value — that is what makes the surface modes below work.

| Spec token | CSS variable | Tailwind utility |
|---|---|---|
| `{colors.primary}` | `--primary` | `bg-primary` `text-primary` `border-primary` |
| `{colors.canvas}` / `{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}` | `--canvas` / `--cloud` / `--fog` | `bg-canvas` `bg-cloud` `bg-fog` |
| `{colors.ink}` / `{colors.charcoal}` / `{colors.graphite}` | `--ink` / `--charcoal` / `--graphite` | `text-ink` `text-charcoal` `text-graphite` |
| `{typography.display-xxl}` … `{typography.price-md}` | — | `text-display-xxl` … `text-price-md` (size + weight + leading + tracking in one class) |
| `{spacing.xxs}` … `{spacing.section}` | — | Tailwind's numeric scale — `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `8` `20` (see below) |
| `{rounded.md}` / `{rounded.xl}` / `{rounded.pill}` | — | `rounded-md` (4px) `rounded-xl` (16px) `rounded-pill` |
| Soft Lift / Floating Modal | — | `shadow-soft-lift` `shadow-floating` |

The shadcn/ui semantic names (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--muted`,
`--border`, …) are kept as **aliases onto these tokens** so components installed
with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` inherit the system automatically
instead of reintroducing the default neutral palette.

`cn()` in `src/lib/utils.ts` registers the custom `text-*`, `rounded-*` and
`shadow-*` token names with tailwind-merge. Without that, `text-body-md` reads
as a text *color* and `cn("text-body-md", "text-ink")` silently drops the size.

### Spacing

The spec's 8px base with a 4px half-step is exactly Tailwind's numeric scale, so
spacing uses numbers rather than token-named utilities:

| Token | Value | Utility |
|---|---|---|
| `{spacing.xxs}` | 4px | `p-1` `gap-1` |
| `{spacing.xs}` | 8px | `p-2` `gap-2` |
| `{spacing.sm}` | 12px | `p-3` `gap-3` |
| `{spacing.md}` | 16px | `p-4` `gap-4` |
| `{spacing.lg}` | 20px | `p-5` `gap-5` |
| `{spacing.xl}` | 24px | `p-6` `gap-6` |
| `{spacing.xxl}` | 32px | `p-8` `gap-8` |
| `{spacing.section}` | 80px | `py-20` |

Declaring `--spacing-md` and friends as named theme keys is a trap: they shadow
Tailwind's container scale, so `max-w-md` resolves to 16px instead of 28rem.

### Surface modes

Iteration Guide #7 says the surface vocabulary is closed. It is enforced as four
classes that re-point the semantic variables for their subtree:

`surface-canvas` · `surface-cloud` · `surface-fog` · `surface-ink`

`surface-ink` is the dark slab: it swaps `{colors.ink}` in as the background,
`{colors.on-ink}` as text, `{colors.ink-soft}` as the card surface, and promotes
`{colors.primary-bright}` over `{colors.primary}` exactly as the Brand & Accent
section requires. Put it on the `help-band-dark`, `promo-strip-dark`,
`utility-strip`, and `footer-dark` wrappers.

There is **no dark color scheme**. The `dark:` variant stays class-gated
(`&:is(.dark *)`) purely so it can never fire from `prefers-color-scheme` and
break the white canvas.

### Components

| Spec component | Code |
|---|---|
| `button-primary` | `<Button>` (default variant) |
| `button-ink` | `<Button variant="ink">` |
| `button-outline` | `<Button variant="outline">` |
| `button-outline-ink` | `<Button variant="secondary">` |
| `button-text-link` | `<Button variant="link">` |
| `card-product`, `card-pricing-tier`, `card-customer-story` | `<Card>` (Soft Lift, `{rounded.xl}`, `{spacing.xl}` padding) |
| `text-input`, `text-input-focused` | `<Input>` |
| `badge-pill-ink` / `badge-pill-outline` / `badge-sale-coral` | `<Badge variant="ink" \| "outline" \| "sale">` |
| Elevation level 3 "Floating Modal" — the `mobile-nav sheet` row | `<Sheet>` (`{colors.paper}` on `{rounded.xl}`, Floating shadow, inset 8px from the viewport) |
| `chevron-decoration` | Not implemented — see below |

`chevron-decoration` is spec'd but deliberately unbuilt. The spec reserves it for
hero bands and full-page banners, and the app has none yet; on the auth card it
read as noise rather than an architectural gesture. Build it when there is a
real hero to flank.

### Motion

The spec is silent on motion, so the rules come from
`.claude/skills/emil-design-eng` and the tokens live alongside the rest in
`@theme` in `apps/web/src/index.css`:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--ease-out-strong` | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` | Anything entering or leaving; hover and press feedback |
| `--ease-in-out-strong` | `cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)` | Movement across the screen |
| `--ease-drawer` | `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` | Panels sliding in from an edge |

Four rules hold everywhere:

- **`ease-in` never appears.** It withholds movement at the exact moment the
  user is watching, so the same duration reads as slower.
- **Nothing exceeds 300ms**, and exits are quicker than entrances — the sheet
  arrives in 280ms and leaves in 200ms.
- **Only `transform`, `opacity`, and colors animate.** `transition-all` is
  never used; every transition names its properties.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the fade and drops the travel.** It is
  implemented by redefining the keyframes inside the media query, so no
  component has to know about it.

Sheet motion is CSS keyframes rather than transitions because Radix drives exit
animations off `animationend`. Everywhere else — hover, press, row highlight —
uses transitions, which retarget mid-flight instead of restarting.

The canvas is the one place motion is choreographed rather than per-element,
because it is where the whole page changes at once and neither change is one
the user's hand is on:

- **Switching mindmaps dissolves.** The outgoing map fades and settles back to
  `scale(0.985)` over 140ms; the incoming one arrives the same way over 240ms
  (`--animate-canvas-out` / `--animate-canvas-in`). The swap is deferred by
  that first 140ms so the two never overlap.
- **An assistant edit plays in three beats**: the tree glides to its new
  layout over 260ms on `--ease-in-out-strong`, the viewport reframes around
  the result over 300ms, and the new topics — held invisible until there was
  somewhere to put them — fade in 45ms apart down the branch
  (`--animate-topic-in`). Node positions are interpolated in React state
  rather than transitioned in CSS: React Flow redraws every connector from the
  positions it is handed, so moving the nodes alone detaches the lines.

### Three deviations, recorded

1. **Hover states.** The spec documents only Default and Pressed. A pointer UI
   needs feedback in between, so filled buttons use `hover:bg-*/90` and land on
   the documented `{colors.primary-deep}` on `:active`. No new colors enter the
   palette.
2. **Button label case.** The Overview says "capitalize labels"; the Typography
   table, the `button-primary` spec, and the Do's list all say uppercase. The
   implementation follows the three-against-one majority and sets uppercase.
3. **Press feedback.** Every pressable element also takes `scale(0.97)` on
   `:active` over 160ms. The spec's Pressed state is a color swap only, which
   on a fast pointer is easy to miss entirely; the scale is what makes a
   control feel like it heard the click. `button-text-link` opts out — a run of
   text shrinking mid-sentence reads as a glitch, not as feedback.

### Font

Forma DJR Micro is licensed, so the substitute recommended by the spec is used
directly with no metric adjustment: **Manrope Variable**, self-hosted via
`@fontsource-variable/manrope` and imported in `apps/web/src/main.tsx`. The
family stack keeps Forma DJR Micro first, so dropping in the licensed webfont
later is a one-line change. Display line-height is pinned to 1.0 and body to
~1.38–1.4 explicitly, per the substitution note above.
